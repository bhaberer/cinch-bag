This plugin is a recurring injoke in a specific open-minded and close-knit IRC Channel about a
bag of takeout food from a burger joint called Dicks. I recreated this plugin to mimic the
behavior of an older IRC bot after people missed the joke/game.

I do not recommend using this plugin. Ever. People will be offended at the _very_ least. :)
